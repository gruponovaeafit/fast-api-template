# Methods Module

This module should contain utility functions that will be used within the routes module.
Functions in this module can help streamline the route functions, allowing for better separation of concerns.

For example:
- Data validation functions
- Data transformation functions
- Helper functions for common operations in routes

Remember to keep each function's purpose clear and avoid overloading with too many responsibilities.
